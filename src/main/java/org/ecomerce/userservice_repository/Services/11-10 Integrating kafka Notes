after adding kafka dependency
we need to create a publisher in service--> in signup req
before executing return statement
publish an event inside a kafka to send user welcome email


how can we create a json in java ?
create a simple obj and convert it into json while sending over the network
        -> we created a classDTO-> with all the details
        -> now we will create obj of this DTO and enter details
        -> after this we will convert this obj of DTO into json obj
{{          WE HAVE PREDEFINED LIBERARY FOR THIS        }}
            ObjectMapper and this library comes from JACKSON
